/** \defgroup QPSolver_doc

  Solves the following strictly convex problem:

  \verbatim
  min          1/2 x' H x + g' x
   x

  subject to
              LBA <= A x <= UBA
              LBX <= x   <= UBX

      with :
        H sparse (n x n) positive definite
        g dense  (n x 1)

      n: number of decision variables (x)
      nc: number of constraints (A)

  \endverbatim

  If H is not positive-definite, the solver should throw an error.
