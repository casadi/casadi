/**
  \brief Sequential Quadratic Programming method.
  The algorithm is a classical SQP method with either exact (may be also provided) or 
  damped BFGS Lagrange Hessian approximation.
  Two different line-search algorithms are available.
  First, Armijo (Wolfe) condition with backtracking (suffers from Maratos effect).
  Second, a line-search method that checks if the merit function is lower
  than the last k values (no Maratos effect).
  Both methods employ the L1 merit function.
  
  The method solves the problems of form:
  \verbatim
  min          F(x)
  x
  
  subject to
            LBG <= G(x) <= UBG
            LBX <=   x  <= UBX
  \endverbatim
  
  Nonlinear equalities can be introduced by setting LBG and UBG equal at the correct positions.
  
  The method is still under development and should be used with care
