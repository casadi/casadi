  /**
     \brief Sequential Quadratic Programming method.
     The algorithm is a classical SQP method with either exact (may be also provided) or 
     damped BFGS Lagrange Hessian approximation.
     Two different line-search algorithms are available.
     First, Armijo (Wolfe) condition with backtracking (suffers from Maratos effect).
     Second, a line-search method that checks if the merit function is lower
     than the last k values (no Maratos effect).
     Both methods employ the L1 merit function.
  
     The method solves the problems of form:
     \verbatim
     min          F(x)
     x
  
     subject to
     LBG <= G(x) <= UBG
     LBX <=   x  <= UBX
     \endverbatim
  
     Nonlinear equalities can be introduced by setting LBG and UBG equal at the correct positions.
  
     The method is still under development and should be used with care
