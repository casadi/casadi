  \brief Interior point method
  This method is experimental only. Do not attempt to use if you do not intend to dive into the source code.
  The current purpose of the class is to show how an IP method can be implemeted in CasADi.
  If someone wants to take responsibility for this class and make it work, then please contact the CasADi developers.
