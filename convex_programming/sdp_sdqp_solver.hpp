   *
   *  Note: this implementation relies on Cholesky decomposition:  Chol(H) = L ->  H = LL' with L lower triangular
   *   This requires Pi, H to be positive definite. Positive semi-definite is not sufficient.
   *    Notably, H==0  will not work.
   *
   *  A better implementation would rely on matrix square root, but we need singular value decomposition to implement that.
