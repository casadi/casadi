#! CasADi provides a mechanism to add assertions in an MX expression graph
#! This can be useful to debug yor code, e.g. debugging why the end-result of a computation yields NaN

#! Consider this example:
x = msym("x")
y = sin(x)
z = sqrt(y)

f = MXFunction([x],[z])
f.init()

f.setInput(5)
f.evaluate()

print f.output()

#! For some mysterious reason we get NaN here

#! Next, we add an assertion: 
y = y.attachAssert(y>0,"bummer") # Add assertion here
z = sqrt(y)

f = MXFunction([x],[z])
f.init()

f.setInput(5)

try:
  f.evaluate()
except Exception as e:
  print "An exception was raised here:"
  print e


#! You can combine this with CustomFunction to do powerful assertions
@pyevaluate
def dummy(f,nfwd,nadj):
  assert nfwd==0
  import numpy
  x = f.getInput()
  m = max(numpy.real(numpy.linalg.eig(blockcat([[x,-1],[-1,2]]))[0]))
  print "m=",m
  f.setOutput(int(m>2))


foo = CustomFunction(dummy, [x.sparsity()], [sp_dense(1,1)] )
foo.setOption("max_number_of_fwd_dir",1)  # Sensitivities may be requested and never used
foo.init()

y = sin(x)

y = y.attachAssert(foo.call([y])[0],"you are in trouble") # Add assertion here
z = sqrt(y)

f = MXFunction([x],[z])
f.init()

f.setInput(5)

f.evaluate()
