# Integrator jacobian
# =====================

from casadi import *
from numpy import *

# We will investigate the working of integrator jacobian with the help of the parametrically exited Duffing equation:
#
# $\ddot{u}+\dot{u}-\epsilon (2 \mu \dot{u}+\alpha u^3+2 k u \cos(\Omega t))$ with $\Omega = 2 + \epsilon \sigma$.

t = SX.sym('t')
u = SX.sym('u')
v = SX.sym('v')

eps   = SX.sym('eps')
mu    = SX.sym('mu')
alpha = SX.sym('alpha')
k     = SX.sym('k')
sigma = SX.sym('sigma')
Omega = 2 + eps*sigma

params = vertcat(eps,mu,alpha,k,sigma)
states = vertcat(u,v)
rhs    = vertcat(v,-u-eps*(2*mu*v+alpha*u**3+2*k*u*cos(Omega*t)))

dae = {'x':states, 'p':params, 't':t, 'ode':rhs}

F = integrator('F', 'cvodes', dae)

# First argument is input index, secpnd argument is output index

jac = F.factory('jac_F', F.name_in(), ['jac:xf:p'])
