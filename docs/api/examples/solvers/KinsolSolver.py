# We will investigate the working of rootfinder with the help of the parametrically exited Duffing equation.
#
# $\ddot{u}+\dot{u}-\epsilon (2 \mu \dot{u}+\alpha u^3+2 k u \cos(\Omega t))$ with $\Omega = 2 + \epsilon \sigma$. \\
#
# The first order solution is $u(t)=a \cos(\frac{1}{2} \Omega t-\frac{1}{2} \gamma)$ with the modulation equations: \\
# $\frac{da}{d\epsilon t} = - \left[ \mu a + \frac{1}{2} k a \sin \gamma \right]$ \\
# $a \frac{d\gamma}{d\epsilon t} = - \left[ -\sigma a + \frac{3}{4} \alpha a^3 + k a \cos \gamma \right]$ \\
#
# We seek the stationair solution to these modulation equations.

# Parameters

eps   = SX.sym("eps")
mu    = SX.sym("mu")
alpha = SX.sym("alpha")
k     = SX.sym("k")
sigma = SX.sym("sigma")

# Variables

a     = SX.sym("a")

# Equations

res0 = mu*a+1.0/2*k*a*sin(gamma)

# Numerical values
