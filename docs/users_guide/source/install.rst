Obtaining and installing
========================

.. include:: defs.rst

|casadi| is an open-source tool, available under LGPL license, which is a permissive license that allows the tool to be used royalty-free also in commercial closed-source applications. The main restriction of LGPL is that if you decide to modify |casadi|'s source code as opposed to just using the tool for your application, these changes (a "derivative-work" of |casadi|) must be released under LGPL as well.

The source code is hosted on GitHub and has a core written in self-contained C++ code, relying on nothing but the C++ Standard Library. Its front-ends to Python and MATLAB/Octave are full-featured and auto-generated using the tool `SWIG <http://www.swig.org/>`_. These front-ends are unlikely to result in noticeable loss of efficiency. |casadi| can be used on Linux, OS X and Windows.
