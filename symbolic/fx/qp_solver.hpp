  \verbatim
  min          1/2 x' H x + g' x 
   x
  
  subject to
              LBA <= A x <= UBA
              LBX <= x   <= UBX
              
      with :
        H sparse (n x n) positive definite
        g dense  (n x 1)
              
      n: number of decision variables (x)
      nc: number of constraints (A)
      
  \endverbatim
  
  If H is not positive-definite, the solver should throw an error.
