/** \brief Piecewise Simulation class
  A ControlSimulator can be seen as a chain of Simulators whereby some parameters change from one Simulator to the next.
  
  These changing parameters can typically be interpreted as "controls" in the context of dynamic optimization.
  
  
  We discriminate between the following time steps:
   * Major time-steps. These are the time steps provided by the supplied grid. Controls are constant inbetween major time-steps\n
   * Minor time-steps. These are time steps linearly interpolated from one major time-step to the next. The option 'nf' regulates how many minor time-steps are taken.\n
   * Integration time-steps. Time steps that the supplied integrator might choose to integrate the continous dynamics. They are not important what ControlSimulator is concerned.\n

  np  Number of parameters
  nu  Number of controls
  ns  The number of major grid points, as supplied in the constructor
  nf  The number of minor grid points per major interval
