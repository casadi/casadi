* \brief interface to IPOPT NLP solver

*
* When in warmstart mode, output NLP_SOLVER_LAM_X may be used as input
*
* NOTE: Even when max_iter == 0,  it is not guaranteed that input(NLP_SOLVER_X0) == output(NLP_SOLVER_X). Indeed if bounds on X or constraints are unmet, they will differ.
*       
*  A good resource about the algorithms in IPOPT is: Wachter and L. T. Biegler, On the Implementation of an Interior-Point Filter Line-Search Algorithm for Large-Scale Nonlinear Programming, Mathematical Programming 106(1), pp. 25-57, 2006 (As Research Report RC 23149, IBM T. J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown, USA
*
* Caveats: 
*   * with default options, multipliers for the decision variables are wrong for equality constraints.
*     Change the 'fixed_variable_treatment' to 'make_constraint' or 'relax_bounds' to obtain correct results.
